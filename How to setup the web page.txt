(Summary of instructions)

Click the Windows/Start button
In the search box at the bottom type "run" and press the enter key. The "Run" dialog box should appear.
In the Run dialog box type: net use * \\webdav.johnshopkins.edu@SSL\your-jhed-id
Example, someone with JHED ID jdoe14 would type net use *\\webdav.johnshopkins.edu@SSL\jdoe14

For me: 

net use * \\webdav.johnshopkins.edu@SSL\maliyou1


(notice that net and use are part of the line)

It may be difficult to tell, but there is a space after the asterisk.
A command prompt window will open and ask for your JHED ID and password.

Muhammed:

Your web space has been created.  The URL is
http://pages.jh.edu/~maliyou1/.

Instructions for accessing the file system and other important information
are at http://it.johnshopkins.edu/services/webservices/webdav.  

Once you have followed the instructions for your particular OS, you will have a
network share you use just like any other disk attached to your computer.
Files must go in the public_html/ directory.  We run SELInux and for this
reason the public_html / directory itself must never be deleted (you can
delete anything within it as needed).

If you use Microsoft Windows and have slow performance with a mapped
network share/drive, go to Control Panel -> Internet Options and click the
"Connections" tab.  On that page, click the "LAN Settings" button.  On
that LAN Settings page, uncheck "Automatically detect settings" and click
OK to back out of the various screens.

If that does not improve performance or you use Mac OS X and have slow
connections, you can download a program called cyberduck from
http://cyberduck.ch.  It may have a silly name, but it is a rock-solid
program that has been around for several years.  You can see a sample
screenshot for the setup at
http://pages.jh.edu/~websvcs/cyberduck-setup.png

You MUST keep a backup of your files should you need to restore any due to
accidental change or deletion.
