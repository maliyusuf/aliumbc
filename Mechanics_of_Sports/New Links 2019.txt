Good Morning Dr. Yousuf,

I hope your Thursday is going well! My name is Ted and I'm reaching out on behalf of Barnet Dulaney Perkins Eye Center, located throughout Arizona.

Today, I came across The Mechanics of Sports page, located here: 
http://pages.jh.edu/~maliyou1/Mechanics_of_Sports/index.html

I found the page to include a highly notable collection of articles and sites related to sports science topics and was wondering if you'd like to provide your readers with an additional sports science resource?

If so, I'd like to suggest adding a resource titled "How Baseball Players See a Fastball" published by Barnet Dulaney Perkins Eye Center which details the science behind a baseball player being able to hit a fastball pitch.  It highlights the amount of time it takes a fastball to travel to home plate vs. the amount of time it takes to blink and a player's ability to predict movement, demonstrating how truly amazing the hitting process is.  I believe this would be a valuable resource to your community, as it is relevant to the resources regarding sports science.

Below is the URL to the resource, if you'd like to share this with your visitors:
https://www.goodeyes.com/bdp-news/how-baseball-players-see-fastball/

Would you be open to including this additional sports science resource on the webpage?

Thank you for your consideration. Do not hesitate to contact me, should you have any questions or need additional information. I look forward to hearing from you soon!


Kind Regards,
Ted Lindblom
