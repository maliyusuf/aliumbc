	<li>	"Cheeseburger Chemistry: Cheese - 
“The Chemistry of Cheese” (part of a 6-part Cheeseburger Chemistry series) uses cheese-making to explain protein denaturing, coagulation, and the difference between chemical and physical change. Also in this collection: news stories on Swiss cheese and Blue (or Bleu) cheese from the NBC News Archives, and graphs and charts on cheese production in the U.S."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Cheeseburger Chemistry: Burgers -
“The Chemistry of Burgers” (part of a 6-part Cheeseburger Chemistry series) outlines myoglobin protein structures and their chemical changes when exposed to heat — part of what turns a patty of red, raw ground beef into a tasty brown burger. Also in this collection: burger-related news stories from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American — plus a Burger-related NBC Learn video."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Cheeseburger Chemistry: The Bun - 
“The Chemistry of Bread” (part of a 6-part Cheeseburger Chemistry series) uses bread-making to illustrate and explain how yeasts work to convert starches and sugars in flour to CO2 gas (fermentation); effects of heat on gas; and gluten protein structures. Also in this collection: news stories on bread-making and grain crops from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American, plus graphs, maps and charts on global wheat production and consumption."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Cheeseburger Chemistry: Tomato - 
“The Chemistry of Tomatoes” (one in a 6-part Cheeseburger Chemistry series) outlines the role ethylene plays in ripening tomatoes (and other fruits); the role of lycopene in color change; anddiffusion of gas. Also in this collection: news stories on tomato mutation, genetic modification and ripening from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American, plus tables and maps on global tomato production, processing and consumption. And the first in our Chance Discoveries series: the story behind Post-it Notes."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Cheeseburger Chemistry: Pickles - 
“The Chemistry of Pickles” (one in a 6-part Cheeseburger Chemistry series) describes the role offermentation, lactic acid, and pH in the process of pickling food to preserve it. (The Latin root of the word “preserve” is traced in a separate Word Root.) Also in this collection: news stories from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American on “bad” bacterial growth on food; the acidification and desalination of ocean water; plus a profile of a proud pickle-maker. Finally: a Pickle History Timeline, and a 1900 recipe for Green Sour Pickles."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Cheeseburger Chemistry: Condiments -
“The Chemistry of Condiments” (one in a 6-part Cheeseburger Chemistry series) uses ketchup, mustard and mayo to explain two different types of mixtures: suspensions and colloidal dispersions (emulsions). Two related Chemistry Now videos explain H2O and emulsions in more depth. Also in this collection: news stories from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American on mixtures; a 1910 recipe for “Mayonnaise Dressing” and, for fun, a history of salad dressings. Plus, a Chance Discovery story on how saccharin, cyclamate and aspartame were discovered"		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Chemistry of Pumpkin Pie - 
Most recipes for Thanksgiving pumpkin pies call for clove and nutmeg — two distinct spices that come from two nearly identical molecules: eugenol and isoeugenol. “The Chemical Bond Between Cloves and Nutmeg” explains how the strength and placement of just one chemical bond makes eugenol responsible for the taste and aroma of cloves, and isoeugenol responsible for the taste and aroma of nutmeg. Also in this Thanksgiving collection: some pumpkin history and background from the NBC Learn collections; facts and figures on pumpkins and spices; and a 1910 Army pumpkin pie recipe that calls for products with the molecular properties of both eugenol and isoeugenol."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>

<li>"Chemistry of Soaps and Detergents - “It's a Wash: The Chemistry of Soap” explains how soap and detergents — surfactants — affect the surface tension of H2O to break up greasy dirt. We also profile 21st Century Chemist Facundo Fernandez at Georgia Tech, who uses chemistry to detect dangerous or ineffective fake pharmaceutical drugs and medicines. Also in this collection: news stories from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American on counterfeit drugs, and on hand-washing and the spread of germs and disease; plus, a history of soap timeline and Victorian-era soap recipes."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
<li>	"Chemistry to Dye For: Dyes - 
An 18-year-old London chemistry student tries to make synthetic quinine for malaria treatment, 
and instead creates the first synthetic dye. We tell the story of this 1856 Chance Discovery that transformed the 
textile industry worldwide. We also profile a 21st century chemist, Purdue's Mary Wirth, whose nanomaterials research 
makes cancer “markers” easier to detect in blood tests. Also in this collection: news stories from the archives of NBC 
News and Scientific American on food and fabric dyes, and cancer screening; and charts showing just how small 
“nanoscale” is."<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Common Scents: Chemistry of Smell - 
Smell that? Our sense of smell is a complex set of chemical reactions. We profile 21st Century Chemist Nate Lewis, who's working to develop an artificial “nose” that can help detect odors, including hazardous gases and chemicals. A story on the carvone molecule adds information on how the nose distinguishes odors. Also in this collection: news stories from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American on air testing, sense of smell (human and canine) — and a Periodic Table of “Smellements.”"		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Cleaning The Ocean: Chemistry of Dispersants - 
On the anniversary of the final capping of the gushing oil well in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, we explain the chemistry of dispersants and immiscibles, in “How to Wash an Ocean.” We also mark the International Year of Chemistry with a video outlining chemistry's “10 Big Questions,” as selected by our content partner, Scientific American. Also in this issue: news stories from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American on the Gulf oil spill and cleanup; a slide show on the oil spill's impact on birds and wetlands, and a chart comparing several notable oil spills."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Chemistry of Plastics: Polyethylene - 
So much of what we wear, sit on, use and touch every day is made, at least in part, of polymer plastics. “Chance Discoveries: Polyethylene” tells the story of how the world's most used plastic was first formed and developed into the “miracle” material of post-WWII America (as explained in a 1945 filmstrip, “The Kingdom of Plastics.”) Also in this collection: news stories from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American on plastics-related health and environmental concerns."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
	<li>	"Chemistry of Cellophane - 
A Swiss chemist tries to stain-proof tablecloths by coating them with a viscous cellulose-based liquid, but it peels off in clear sheets when it dries. That new material, when refined, revolutionizes the way food is packaged and sold. Also in this collection: news stories from the archives of NBC News and Scientific American on food packaging, and vintage cellophane ads. We also profile Georgia Tech molecule designer Stefan France, who hopes his work will stop or slow effects in the brain of diseases such as Alzheimer's."		<a href="	http://nbclearn.com/portal/site/learn/freeresources/chemistry-now	">	Video	</a></li>
